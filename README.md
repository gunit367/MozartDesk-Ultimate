MozartDesk Ultimate: 
Our program contain two racket files:
- 60% Prototype.rkt is our main racket file that create our composer program.
- world-save.rkt is the modified version of magic-write.rkt that allows us to translate our current world into a string and also translate it back into a world; this will be used for save and load function.
